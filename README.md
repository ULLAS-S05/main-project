# Neuro Streamlit Application

This is a Streamlit-based interactive application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for health and neural-related checks. The application uses visual elements and page navigation to guide users through different functionalities.

## Features
- Interactive Streamlit web application
- Custom background and UI styling
- Page navigation using buttons
- Collapsed sidebar for a clean UI
- Multiple pages support (Eye check and Progress check)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- HTML & CSS (for UI customization)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/your-username/neuro-streamlit-app.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:


cd neuro-streamlit-app

3. Install dependencies:


pip install streamlit


## How to Run
Run the application using:


streamlit run NEURO.py


## Usage
- Launches a homepage with two options:
  - **Use Your Eye** – navigates to eye-related analysis
  - **Check Your Progress** – navigates to progress/leg-related analysis

## Future Enhancements
- Add ML models for prediction
- Improve UI responsiveness
- Deploy application to Streamlit Cloud

# Neuro – Interactive Health Monitoring Application

Neuro is a Python-based Streamlit web application developed to demonstrate interactive UI design, page navigation, and basic health monitoring workflows using modern web technologies.

## Objective
To build an interactive multi-page Streamlit application with custom UI elements for health-related checks.

## Key Highlights
- Streamlit-based web interface
- Custom CSS for background and button styling
- Multi-page navigation
- Beginner-friendly Python project

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Streamlit Framework
- HTML & CSS

## Application Pages
- **Home Page** – Main dashboard with navigation buttons
- **Eye Module (pew.py)** – Eye-related interaction
- **Progress Module (leg.py)** – Progress tracking interface

## Setup Instructions
1. Ensure Python is installed
2. Install Streamlit:


pip install streamlit

3. Run the application:


streamlit run NEURO.py


## Output
The application opens in a browser at:


http://localhost:8501


## Limitations
- No database integration
- No machine learning model currently implemented

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical usage of Streamlit for building interactive Python applications and can be extended into a full health monitoring system.

## Installation & Execution
```bash
pip install streamlit
streamlit run NEURO.py

How It Works

The homepage displays two interactive options

Clicking buttons redirects users to separate Streamlit pages

Pages are handled using st.switch_page()

Use Cases

Academic mini project

Streamlit UI practice

Health-tech prototype

Future Scope

Integrate ML models

Add database support

### 🔥 My Recommendation
Use **Option 3** for **GitHub + placements**  
Use **Option 2** for **college submission**

If you want, I can:
- Customize README exactly for **malnutrition / medical project**
- Add **screenshots section**
- Make it **ATS & recruiter friendly**

Just tell me 👍
